# Welcome to my project showcase ! 
<br/>
Here, you'll find links to some of the key projects I've worked on, each reflecting my passion for development and creativity. From applications built with C#/.NET to Angular and innovative tools, these projects highlight my skills. Feel free to explore each one to see the code, learn about the challenges I faced, and discover how I approached each project.

## Projects
<br/>
- ChronoTimer

ChronoTimer is designed to time exercise intervals followed by rest periods. This project serves as a personal endeavor to rediscover MAUI .NET across Mac, iOS, and Android environments. It started as a small project to fulfill a personal need but has the potential to evolve based on user feedback and suggestions.

If you have an Android phone, try it by [dowloading app's apk here](https://github.com/JasLieb/ChronoTimer/releases/download/v1.0.0/com.jaslieb.chronotimer.maui-Signed.apk) !
Application installation from unknown sources must be granted, [see more there](https://www.appaloosa.io/blog/guides/how-to-install-apps-from-unknown-sources-in-android).
Repo available through [this link](https://github.com/JasLieb/ChronoTimer).

- DistrictAid

DistrictAid is an application designed to tackle food waste and minimize environmental impacts through positive actions. This initiative is part of the Masterâ€™s program at Ynov Toulouse and was developed by a multidisciplinary team in areas such as development, design, and marketing, 

The app is divided into the front and back part. The front utilizes the Flutter framework and Dart programming language and the back is written in JS in a Node environment powered by Docker.
Repo and some public resources available through [this link](https://github.com/JasLieb/district-aid).

- Super Caisse

The Super Caisse project is a result of the computer architecture course I took during my master's at Ynov. By simulating a cashier and a website need with online order, it was through testing that the project was designed. 

The Core and Tests projects are the most important here, in order to follow available 'functionalities'. The WebApi project with the embedded Angular client is merely an optional task that was never completed.

- Goldfish News (random-news-reader)

GoldfishNews is a random, unfiltered RSS feed aggregator.
Developed during a collaborative project as part of my Bachelor's program, the application utilizes HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Python, and PostgreSQL.
